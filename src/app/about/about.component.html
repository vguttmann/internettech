    <h1>Chatbot Implementation Details</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This page outlines the implementation details of a chatbot designed to interact with users, gather information
        through a series of questions, and provide advice based on the user's responses. The chatbot uses predefined
        data stored in JSON files and utilizes a state machine to manage the conversation flow.</p>

    <h2>Components and Data</h2>
    <p>The chatbot uses several JSON files to store necessary data:</p>

    <p><code>questions.json</code>: Contains the questions to be asked to the user.<br>
    <code>generals.json</code>: Contains general actions and keywords for state transitions.<br>
    <code>answers.json</code>: Contains keywords for positive and negative responses.<br>
    <code>drones.json</code>: Contains data on various drones, including characteristics and descriptions.<br>
    <code>weight.json</code>: Contains weights for different characteristics used in evaluation.</p>


    <h2>Session Management</h2>
    <p>Each user interaction is managed through a <code>BotSession</code> class instance, which maintains the state of
        the
        conversation, user responses, and evaluation results.</p>

    <h3>Session ID Generator</h3>
    <p>A session ID generator <code>_sid_generator</code> ensures each session has a unique identifier.</p>

    <h3>Session Initialization</h3>
    <p>The <code>BotSession</code> constructor initializes the session with the following:</p>

    <p>Loading data from JSON files.<br>
    Setting initial states (<code>state</code> and <code>last</code>).<br>
    Initializing a question iterator.<br>
    Setting up an empty knowledge base and evaluation list.</p>


    <h2>State Machine</h2>
    <p>The chatbot uses a state machine to handle conversation flow. The main states include:</p>

    <p><code>greet</code>: Initial greeting state.<br>
    <code>asking</code>: Asking questions from the predefined list.<br>
    <code>change</code>: Handling changes in questions.<br>
    <code>capabilities</code>: Responding to inquiries about the chatbot's capabilities.<br>
    <code>start</code> and <code>exit</code>: Managing the beginning and end of the session.<br>
    <code>evaluation</code>: Evaluating the user's responses and providing recommendations.<br>
    <code>finished</code>: Concluding the session.</p>


    <h3>Conversation Flow</h3>
    <p><strong>Greeting State:</strong></p>
    <p>The session starts in the <code>greet</code> state. If the user inquires about capabilities, the state
        transitions to
        <code>capabilities</code>, otherwise to <code>asking</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Asking Questions:</strong></p>
    <p>The chatbot asks questions sequentially. User responses are analyzed to update the state or continue asking
        questions.</p>

    <p><strong>Change State:</strong></p>
    <p>Handles requests to change answers. Reverts to <code>asking</code> after changes are confirmed.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities State:</strong></p>
    <p>Provides information about the chatbot's capabilities. Reverts to the previous state after handling the
        inquiry.</p>

    <p><strong>Start and Exit States:</strong></p>
    <p>Handles the start or end of a session based on user confirmation.</p>

    <p><strong>Evaluation State:</strong></p>
    <p>Compiles user responses to generate advice or recommendations.</p>

    <p><strong>Finished State:</strong></p>
    <p>Concludes the session and provides final actions or recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Answer Generation</h3>
    <p>The <code>generate_answer</code> method manages state transitions and generates appropriate responses.</p>

    <h3>Helper Methods</h3>

    <p><code>_check_for_general</code>: Matches user input with general actions.<br>
    <code>_get_result</code>: Processes user responses to derive results.<br>
    <code>_negated</code>: Checks for negation in user responses.<br>
    <code>_confirmed</code>: Confirms user responses based on positive keywords.<br>
    <code>_create_advice</code>: Evaluates user responses and generates recommendations.</p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This chatbot implementation provides a structured and interactive user experience through a well-defined state
        machine and data-driven approach. By leveraging various JSON files for storing questions, general actions,
        answers,
        drone data, and weights, the chatbot can dynamically interact with users, gather information, and provide
        tailored
        advice based on user inputs.</p>
