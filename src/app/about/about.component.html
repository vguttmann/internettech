    <h1>Chatbot Implementation Details</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This page details the implementation of a chatbot designed to interact with users, collect information through a series of questions, and offer advice based on their responses. The chatbot uses predefined data stored in JSON files and makes use of a state machine to manage the conversation flow.</p>

    <h2>Components and Data</h2>
    <p>The chatbot uses several JSON files to store necessary data:</p>

    <p><code>questions.json</code>: Contains the questions to be asked to the user.<br>
    <code>generals.json</code>: Contains general actions and keywords for state transitions.<br>
    <code>answers.json</code>: Contains keywords for positive and negative responses.<br>
    <code>drones.json</code>: Contains data on various microcontrollers, including characteristics and descriptions.<br>
    <code>weight.json</code>: Contains weights for different characteristics used in evaluation.</p>


    <h2>Session Management</h2>
    <p>Each user interaction is managed through a <code>BotSession</code> class, which keeps track of the answers, state and everything else related to the session.</p>

    <h3>Session ID Generator</h3>
    <p>A session ID generator <code>_sid_generator</code> ensures each session has a unique identifier.</p>

    <h3>Session Initialization</h3>
    <p>The <code>BotSession</code> constructor initializes the session with the following:</p>

    <p>Loading data from JSON files.<br>
    Setting initial states (<code>state</code> and <code>last</code>).<br>
    Initializing a question iterator.<br>
    Setting up an empty knowledge base and evaluation list.</p>


    <h2>State Machine</h2>
    <p>The chatbot uses a state machine to handle conversation flow. The main states include:</p>

    <p><code>greet</code>: Initial greeting state.<br>
    <code>asking</code>: Asking questions from the predefined list.<br>
    <code>change</code>: Handling changes in questions.<br>
    <code>capabilities</code>: Responding to inquiries about the chatbot's capabilities.<br>
    <code>start</code> and <code>exit</code>: Managing the beginning and end of the session.<br>
    <code>evaluation</code>: Evaluating the user's responses and providing recommendations.<br>
    <code>finished</code>: Concluding the session.</p>


    <h3>Conversation Progression</h3>
    <p><strong>Greeting:</strong></p>
    <p>The session starts in the <code>greet</code> state. If the user inquires about capabilities, the state
        transitions to
        <code>capabilities</code>, otherwise to <code>asking</code>.</p>

    <p><strong>Asking Questions:</strong></p>
    <p>The chatbot asks questions sequentially. User responses are analyzed to update the state or continue asking
        questions.</p>

    <p><strong>Change State:</strong></p>
    <p>Handles requests to change answers. Reverts to <code>asking</code> after changes are confirmed.</p>

    <p><strong>Capabilities State:</strong></p>
    <p>Provides information about the chatbot's capabilities. Reverts to the previous state after handling the
        inquiry.</p>

    <p><strong>Start and Exit States:</strong></p>
    <p>Handles the start or end of a session based on user confirmation.</p>

    <p><strong>Evaluation State:</strong></p>
    <p>Compiles user responses to generate advice or recommendations.</p>

    <p><strong>Finished State:</strong></p>
    <p>Concludes the session and provides final actions or recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Answer Generation</h3>
    <p>The <code>generate_answer</code> method manages state transitions and generates appropriate responses.</p>

    <h3>Helper Methods</h3>

    <p><code>_check_for_general</code>: Matches user input with general actions.<br>
    <code>_get_result</code>: Processes user responses to derive results.<br>
    <code>_negated</code>: Checks for negation in user responses.<br>
    <code>_confirmed</code>: Confirms user responses based on positive keywords.<br>
    <code>_create_advice</code>: Evaluates user responses and generates recommendations.</p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The chatbot implementation offers a structured and interactive user experience through a well-defined state machine and data-driven approach. By utilizing various JSON files to store questions, actions, answers, drone data, and weights, the chatbot can dynamically engage with users, gather information, and provide tailored advice based on their inputs.</p>
